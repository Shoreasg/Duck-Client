## A Bizzare Announcement

In our last [post](https://duck.community/blog/postbag-from-the-pond-1#projectponds-update) we briefly mentioned Project Ponds being a secretive NFT project the duck team are working on in the sidelines.

Now that the project is nearly ready to go-live we are able to share more details about it.

People often ask the duck team if we are worried that ducks haven't minted out yet. We aren't worried about the ones we haven't sold when we are too busy developing for the ducks that we have.

From the beginning of the NFD project, we always wanted to provide more value to our holders through the development efforts we undertook, Bizzare Biomes is now one of these efforts we will celebrate with NFD holders.

So get a cup of tea, kick back, and let's catch everyone up to speed to what the heck we are talking about.

(The specific numbers in this post are subject to change in the coming weeks due to the variance of NFD holders at any one time)

## Supply and mint

Bizzare Biomes has a fixed supply of 2500 tokens. The first 50 minted will be the teams allocation. The next 1250 minted will be to airdropped accounts which we will discuss in the next section.  1100 will be available to purchase from the website at a later time. 200 will form part of the marketing strategy which we will mint and distribute over time.

The mint price is yet to be announced. We are taking current market conditions into consideration.

| Key          | Value  |
|--------------|--------|
| Total Supply | 2500   |
| Airdrop      | 1250   |
| Public Sale  | 1100   |
| Marketing    | 200    |
| Team         | 50     |

## Airdrop distribution

1250 - or 50% of the total supply of Bizzare Biomes will be minted to NFD holders. We will keep the distribution infomation private until the snapshot has taken place.

We will announce the date of the snapshot ahead of time, so that NFD holders are aware.

There is still time to become a holder (if you aren't already) either from primary sales from our site or adopting from secondary.

**NFD's held on marketplaces at the time of the snapshot will not be eligible for airdrops, and the extra allocation will be redistributed. Delist any NFDs you have at this time**

A reminder if you have an old ZRC-1 duck without a colour background, to sign into [duck.community](https://duck.community) and on the wallet/your ducks page there will be an option to migrate this duck. ZRC-1 ducks will be valid for this airdrop.

**It is highly recommended you migrate your old ZRC-1 duck to the new ZRC-6 standard. This airdrop will include ZRC-1 holders which haven't migrated but future airdrops will not include ZRC-1 ducks!  Message on our Discord if you need help migrating.**

## Utility preview

Each biome is equipped to model the current owners held NFT in a meta portrait gallery.

As the owners change and more NFT's are added and removed from a wallet, your biomic gallery will always reflect the current state of your wallet. The below image is a what Nines wallet looks like in a test Biome!

All ZRC-6 NFT's who follow ZRC-7 will be instantly available to view - no more requests to websites to add your NFT, your Biome covers it all.

The get all users NFTs functionality for Biomes is pulled directly from the work Ducks have developed to get Zilkroad working. If you'd like to intergrate this dynamic NFT logic into your site, check out the service [zildexr.com](https://zildexr.com) which we're making available to the public today!

More details will be put on the site soon regarding how to access these services, stay tuned over there if that intrests you as a builder.

## Artistic preview

Biomes are made of three attributes - foreground, background and item.

These example biomes have different foregrounds and backgrounds but all include the pancake item.

## Bizzare Biomes future roadmap

The Biomes project is considered finished as-is, and does not have a future roadmap. 

However, Biomes form part of a larger roadmap for NFD holders.

A portion of Biomes (and NFD) royalty will be used to distribute back to NFD holders as part of an ongoing analysis piece on sharing royalty revenue between the holders.

More on this in the coming weeks, probably after Zilkroad mainnet release and royalty starts to become more important.

## In other news

The Duck team wishes farewell to GreenyWeeny as he steps away from project work. Greeny was responsible for the social media content posted through the duck twitter and produced the teaser videos for Zilkroad. Salute for your contributions sir and we will see you in the pond.

And as such, we're looking for a duck to come and join our team to lead our Marketing department. You'll be working closely with the team to create marketing strategies and promotions of Ducks, Zilkroad and other projects.

If you've got marketing knowledge, and fancy joining the team, drop us a quick 2 min video about why you would be good for this role and any other relevant experience. Upload this as a private youtube link (we don't and won't download files) and send it as a DM to Nines#0643 on Discord.

The Zilkroad beta is scheduled to be deployed to a selected group of community beta testers on Friday May 20th. Hopefully this won't take long and we can schedule a deployment to mainnet ASAP. We really appreciate your patience, trust me, it'll be worth the wait.
